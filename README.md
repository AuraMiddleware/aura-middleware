# Aura Middleware

Aura Middleware is a semantic middleware for the Internet of Things. Its main objective is:

> To facilitate the development of IoT applications by abstracting the
differences among devices, making then work together in a soft and easy manner.

Aura, from latin, means *breeze*. A developer using Aura to manage IoT devices should feel it like breeze to develop applications to many different devices and technologies: soft, tranquil.

Using Aura, a developer is provided with a RESTful API through which is possible to easily know what kind of sensors and actuators are available. This means that the developer knows *what is possible to do* with the connected devices, like sensing temperature and turning electronics on and off. Furthermore, Aura tells what device can do what actions or what it can sense, allowing applications to create conditions and send commands to specific devices.
